===============================

This project aims to make a real-time strategy game that is meant to be played by artificial intelligences rather than humans.

The game itself will not be overly complex or innovative, but will have a good interface and features to let users design their armies' behaviour with little non-AI code needed.

The code itself aims to be as maintainable as possible, relying on different decoupling principles to organize the project.

Progress: 2%
